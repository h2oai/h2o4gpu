# H2O4GPU

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/h2oai/h2o4gpu](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/h2oai/h2o4gpu)

**H2O4GPU** is a collection of GPU solvers by
[H2Oai](https://www.h2o.ai/).  It builds upon the easy-to-use
[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) API and its well-tested
CPU-based algorithms.  It can be used as a drop-in replacement for
scikit-learn (i.e. `import h2o4gpu as sklearn`) with support for GPUs
on selected (and ever-growing) algorithms.  H2O4GPU inherits all the
existing scikit-learn algorithms and falls-back to CPU aglorithms when
the GPU algorithm does not support an important existing Scikit-learn
class option.

An R API is in developement and will be released as a stand-alone R package in the future.

## Requirements

* PC with Ubuntu 16.04+ w/ GCC4.9+

* Install CUDA with bundled display drivers (
  [CUDA 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
  or
  [CUDA 9](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-release-candidate-download) )

When installing, choose to link the cuda install to /usr/local/cuda .
Ensure to reboot after installing the new nvidia drivers.

* Nvidia GPU with Compute Capability >= 3.5 ([Capability Lookup](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)).

* For advanced features, like handling rows/32 > 2^16 (i.e., rows > 2,097,152) in K-means, need Capability >= 5.2

## Installation

Add to `~/.bashrc` or environment (set appropriate paths for your OS):

```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda # or choose /usr/local/cuda9 for cuda9 and /usr/local/cuda8 for cuda8
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDA_HOME/lib64/:$CUDA_HOME/lib/:$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64
```

- Install OpenBlas dev environment:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev pbzip2
```

Download the Python wheel file (For Python 3.6 on linux_x86_64):

  * [For Conda (unsupported and untested by H2O.ai)]
    ```
        pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.anaconda.org/gpuopenanalytics/simple h2o4gpu
    ```

The "nccl" (NCCL) versions give support to multi-GPU in xgboost and in other algorithms.  The "nonccl" versions are provided
in case of system instability in production environments due to NCCL.
 
Start a fresh pyenv or virtualenv session.

Install the Python wheel file. NOTE: If you don't use a fresh environment, this will
overwrite your py3nvml and xgboost installations to use our validated
versions.

```
pip install h2o4gpu-0.2.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Test your installation

```
import h2o4gpu
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1.,1.], [1.,4.], [1.,0.]])
model = h2o4gpu.KMeans(n_clusters=2,random_state=1234).fit(X)
model.cluster_centers_
```
Should give input/output of:
```
>>> import h2o4gpu
>>> import numpy as np
>>>
>>> X = np.array([[1.,1.], [1.,4.], [1.,0.]])
>>> model = h2o4gpu.KMeans(n_clusters=2,random_state=1234).fit(X)
>>> model.cluster_centers_
array([[ 1.,  1.  ],
       [ 1.,  4.  ]])
```

For more examples check our [Jupyter notebook demos](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o4gpu/tree/master/examples/py/demos).

To run the demos using a local wheel run, at least download requirements_runtime_demos.txt from the github repo and do:
```
pip install -r requirements_runtime_demos.txt
```
and then run the jupyter notebook demos.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks with Docker

Requirements:

* Nvidia drivers compatible with CUDA version used (e.g. 384+ for CUDA9)
* [docker-ce 17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [nvidia-docker 1.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/tree/1.0)

Download the Docker file (for linux_x86_64):

  * Bleeding edge:
    * [CUDA8 nccl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/releases/bleeding-edge/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.2-nccl-cuda8/h2o4gpu-0.2.0-nccl-cuda8-runtime.tar.bz2)
    * [CUDA8 nonccl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/releases/bleeding-edge/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.2-nonccl-cuda8/h2o4gpu-nonccl-cuda8-0.2.0-runtime.tar.bz2)
    * [CUDA9 nccl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/releases/bleeding-edge/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.2-nccl-cuda9/h2o4gpu-0.2.0-nccl-cuda9-runtime.tar.bz2)
    * [CUDA9 nonccl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/releases/bleeding-edge/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.2-nonccl-cuda9/h2o4gpu-0.2.0-nonccl-cuda9-runtime.tar.bz2)

Load and run docker file (e.g. for bleeding-edge of nccl-cuda9):
```
pbzip2 -dc h2o4gpu-0.2.0-nccl-cuda9-runtime.tar.bz2 | nvidia-docker load
mkdir -p log ; nvidia-docker run --name localhost --rm -p 8888:8888 -u `id -u`:`id -g` -v `pwd`/log:/log --entrypoint=./run.sh opsh2oai/h2o4gpu-0.2.0-nccl-cuda9-runtime &
find log -name jupyter* -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -k1 -n | awk '{print $2}' | tail -1 | xargs cat | grep token | grep http | grep -v NotebookApp
```
Copy/paste the http link shown into your browser.  If the link shows no token or shows ... for token, try a token of "h2o" (without quotes).  If running on your own host, the weblink will look like http://localhost:8888:token with token replaced by the actual token.

This container has a /demos directory which contains Jupyter notebooks and some data.

## Plans and RoadMap

The vision is to develop fast GPU algorithms to complement the CPU
algorithms in scikit-learn while keeping full scikit-learn API
compatibility and scikit-learn CPU algorithm capability. The h2o4gpu
Python module is to be used as a drop-in-replacement for scikit-learn
that has the full functionality of scikit-learn's CPU algorithms.

Functions and classes will be gradually overridden by GPU-enabled algorithms (unless
`n_gpu=0` is set and we have no CPU algorithm except scikit-learn's).
The CPU algorithms and code initially will be sklearn, but gradually
those may be replaced by faster open-source codes like those in Intel
DAAL.

This vision is currently accomplished by using the open-source
scikit-learn and xgboost and overriding scikit-learn calls with our
own GPU versions.  In cases when our GPU class is currently
incapable of an important scikit-learn feature, we revert to the
scikit-learn class.

As noted above, there is an R API in development, which will be
released as a stand-alone R package.  All algorithms supported by
H2O4GPU will be exposed in both Python and R in the future.

Another primary goal is to support all operations on the GPU via the
[GOAI
initiative](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/goai-open-gpu-accelerated-data-analytics/).
This involves ensuring the GPU algorithms can take and return GPU
pointers to data instead of going back to the host.  In scikit-learn
API language these are called fit\_ptr, predict\_ptr, transform\_ptr,
etc., where ptr stands for memory pointer.

 "ROADMAP.")

## Solver Classes

Among others, the solver can be used for the following classes of problems

  + GLM: Lasso, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, Elastic Net Regulariation
  + KMeans
  + Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) via [XGBoost](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/gradient-boosting-decision-trees-xgboost-cuda/)
  + Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) + Truncated Singular Value Decomposition
  + Principal Components Analysis(PCA)

Planned:
  + GLM: Linear SVM, Huber Fitting, Total Variation Denoising, Optimal Control, Linear Programs and Quadratic Programs.

## Benchmarks

Our benchmarking plan is to clearly highlight when modeling benefits
from the GPU (usually complex models) or does not (e.g. one-shot
simple models dominated by data transfer).

We have benchmarked h2o4gpu, scikit-learn, and h2o-3 on a variety of
solvers.  Some benchmarks have been performed for a few selected cases
that highlight the GPU capabilities (i.e. compute or on-GPU memory
operations dominate data transfer to GPU from host):

[Benchmarks for GLM, KMeans, and XGBoost for CPU vs. GPU.](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o4gpu/blob/master/presentations/benchmarks.pdf)

A suite of benchmarks are computed when doing "make testperf" from a
build directory. These take all of our tests and benchmarks h2o4gpu
against h2o-3.  These will soon be presented as a live
commit-by-commit streaming plots on a website.
