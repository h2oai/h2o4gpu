# H2O4GPU

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/h2oai/h2o4gpu](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/h2oai/h2o4gpu)

**H2O4GPU** is a collection of GPU (and CPU) solvers by H2Oai, as drop-in replacement of sklearn with GPU capabilities.

## Requirements

* Install [CUDA 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

## Installation

Add to `~/.bashrc` or environment (set appropriate paths for your OS):

```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDA_HOME/lib64/:$CUDA_HOME/lib/:$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64
```

Download the Python wheel file

  * (TBA) [Stable](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/stable/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.0.3/h2o4gpu-0.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl)
  * [Bleeding edge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/h2o4gpu/nightly/ai/h2o/h2o4gpu/0.0.3/h2o4gpu-0.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl)
 
Install the Python wheel file:

```
pip install h2o4gpu-0.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```

Test your installation

```
import h2o4gpu
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1.,1.], [1.,4.], [1.,0.]])
model = h2o4gpu.KMeans(n_clusters=2).fit(X)
model.fit(X).cluster_centers_
```

## Plans and RoadMap

Vision is to have a drop-in replacement for scikit-learn that has the full functionality of sklearn, but gradually modules or classes are replaced by GPU-enabled algorithms.

## Solver Classes

Among others, the solver can be used for the following classes of problems

  + GLM: Lasso, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, Elastic Net Regulariation,
  + KMeans

Planned:
  + GLM: Huber Fitting, Total Variation Denoising, Optimal Control, Linear Programs and Quadratic Programs.
  + SVD, PCA
