Thank you for taking time to improve this repository!

Before submitting a PR please make sure that:

1. It is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then:

  2.1. There is an issue in the tracker for your PR. If there isn't one please make one first.
  
  2.2. Your changes are in a separate branch. Branches should have descriptive names (e.g. starting with `fix/` or `feature/`).

  2.3. Commit messages adhere to our contributor guide.

  2.4. There is only a single commit (otherwise squash them).

  2.5. Project builds, all the tests are passing for you locally and the general rules from our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) are met. Otherwise make changes and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).
  
3. Great, you are ready to open a new PR!

  3.1 Come up with a descriptive, short, title.
  
  3.2 Write a short (but meaningful) summary explaining the changes.
  
  3.3 Be sure to add `closes #XXX` in the comment to auto-close the issue that the PR fixes.
  
  3.4 **Remove this template before submitting.**
